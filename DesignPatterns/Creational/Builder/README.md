### Intention

- Allows us to write more readable, understandable code to create complex objects.
- Mostly implemented with a fluent interface, readability of the source code is close to ordinary written prose.

Other type of implementation is;
- Defines an instance for creating an object but lettings subclasses to decide which type of object is created.
- Refers to the newly created objects through a common interface
